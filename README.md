## Average Execution Time Of Each Vector Size: 2^20, 2^24, and 2^30
30 runs of the program were executed to get the average exectution time of each kernel of each size and each version.

### Debug Version
| Vector Size | Assembly Kernel | C Kernel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2^20** | 0.001300 | 0.002567 |
| **2^24** | 0.020233 | 0.044133 |
| **2^30** | 1.332500 | 2.793433 |

### Release Version
| Vector Size | Assembly Kernel | C Kernel |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2^20** | 0.001267 | 0.001367 |
| **2^24** | 0.020000 | 0.020033 |
| **2^30** | 1.353367 | 1.322067 |
