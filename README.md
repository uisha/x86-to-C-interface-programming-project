# Average Execution Time Of Each Vector Size: 2^20, 2^24, and 2^30
30 runs of the program were executed to get the average exectution time of each kernel of each size and each version.
| Vector Size | Debug Version | Release Version |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **2^20** | 0.001267 | 0.001100 |
| **2^24** | 0.001267 | 0.001100 |
| **2^30** | 0.001267 | 0.001100 |
